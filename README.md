# Preamp Two

Here is my project to build a Hi-Fi preamplifier. This repository includes schematics, PCB layouts, CircuitPython code, BoMs, measurements and photos.

Features:

* High performance design with measurements
* Quality components
* Completely digitally Controlled
* Modular design
* All open source

### Components

The preamplifier is made up of a number of connected components:

* [MDAC attenuator](https://github.com/FutureSharks/preamp-two/tree/master/PCBs/mdac-attenuator): Controls the volume
* [Input selector](https://github.com/FutureSharks/preamp-two/tree/master/PCBs/input-selector): Selects the input
* [Micro controller board](https://github.com/FutureSharks/preamp-two/tree/master/PCBs/mcu-board): Holds the micro controller and other connectors
* [Encoder panels](https://github.com/FutureSharks/preamp-two/tree/master/PCBs/encoder-panel): Holds rotary encoder and LED indicator
* [RCA panel](https://github.com/FutureSharks/preamp-two/tree/master/PCBs/rca-panel): For the RCA sockets and connectors
